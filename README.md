So as the description say "Keeping track of the my lab classes"

Initially commits are for the subject - "Python"

Later I realized this repo is getting messed up so the new commits got the subject name accordingly 
        such as - Regression Ananlysis
                  Time Series Ananlysis
                  Machine Learning
So just look for the subject 1st then the for the "Particular Code" u r looking for.


Thank You If u have come this far. :)
